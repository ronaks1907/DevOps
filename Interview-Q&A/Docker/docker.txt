2. What is containerization?
Ans :- Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to encapsulate an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a "container." 
Docker applications run in containers that can be used on any system: a developerâ€™s laptop, systems on premises, or in the cloud. (it runs the same)
Containers share the host operating system's kernel, but they have their own isolated file system, processes, and networking.
